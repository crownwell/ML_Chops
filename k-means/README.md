# K Means (KM)
KM is an unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to cluster data into a specified number of groups, K based on feature similarity. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each feature set to one of K groups. This is accomplished using centroids (the center points of each group or cluster) which are obtained through optimization.
