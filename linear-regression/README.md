# Linear Regression (LR)
LR is a simple model for predicting continuous data outputs. Say you want to predict the price per barrel of crude oil in Nigeria for tomorrow, next week or next month. With data on the prices over the years or past months, you can make a fairly accurate forecast of what the price would be using LR. This assumes the data is correlated (positively or negatively). If it's not correlated, then LR is not a good fit. There are other ML algorithms for such type of data.

## Implementation
This implementation works for only 2-dimensional (x and y) data. In practice, you may have data in more than 2 dimensions. The principle is still same, although the algorithm becomes a little more complex as you deal with more dimensions.
