# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple model for predicting continuous data outputs.

## Implementation
This implementation works for only 2-dimensional (x and y) data. You may have 3-dimensional data, 4-dimensional data and so on. The principle is still the same, although the algorithm becomes a little more complex as you deal with more dimensions.
